# selectmore

<!-- badges: end -->

`{selectmore}` provides extensions built on top of `{tidyselect}` for more flexible and powerful column subsetting patterns.

## Installation

You can install the development version of selectmore from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("yjunechoe/selectmore")
```

## Example

```{r example}
library(selectmore)
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
df <- data.frame(
  x_1 = 1,
  x_2 = 2,
  y_2 = 3,
  y_1 = 4,
  y_3 = 5,
  x_3 = 6,
  nomatch = 0
)
df
```

Baseline comparison with `matches()`:

```{r}
df %>%
  select(matches("(x|y)_(\\d)"))
```

Match *and* order with `match_order()`:

```{r}
# Order with priority on keeping the letters (1st group) close together
df %>%
  select(match_order("(x|y)_(\\d)", c(1, 2)))

# Similar to above, but sort letters in reverse order
df %>%
  select(match_order("(x|y)_(\\d)", c(-1, 2)))

# Order with priority on keeping the numbers (2nd group) close together
df %>%
  select(match_order("(x|y)_(\\d)", c(2, 1)))

# Same as above, the 2nd group is "slowest" because it has more categories
df %>%
  select(match_order("(x|y)_(\\d)", order_by = "slowest"))
```

Rename columns using `{unglue}` syntax with `match_rename()`:

```{r}
df %>% 
  select(
    match_order("(x|y)_(\\d)"), # Match columns on pattern and sorts by fastest
    everything()                # Grab the leftover columns (`nomatch`)
  ) %>% 
  # Rename matching columns using `unglue::unglue_sub()` syntax
  rename(match_rename("{letter}_{number}", list(toupper, ~ .x * 10)))
```
